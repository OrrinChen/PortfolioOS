# Multi-Factor Alpha Validation Engine

A PIT-safe, redundancy-aware, cost-aware institutional factor research and
backtest system.

This standalone project lives under `projects/multifactor_alpha_validation/`.
It does not replace the root PortfolioOS roadmap, does not enter Q2 directly,
and does not claim production approval.

## Scope

The engine converts a small MVP factor library into:

- FactorSpec contracts
- PIT timestamp validation
- deterministic local signal panels
- AlphaView-compatible predictive views
- raw and neutralized Q1-style evidence
- redundancy and marginal-value decisions
- posterior shrinkage and covariance diagnostics
- factor-level nonnegative allocation
- zero-weight attribution
- cost, capacity, and benchmark survival
- final registry, report, dashboard, and manifest

## Commands

```bash
make factor-spec-validate
make factor-signals
make factor-q1
make factor-redundancy
make factor-shrinkage
make factor-allocator
make factor-survival
make factor-registry
make factor-report
make factor-dashboard
make factor-validate
```

## Boundaries

- Missing coverage is explicit abstain.
- `no_view != zero_alpha`.
- Analyst revision remains disabled without a PIT estimate source.
- Outputs do not enter Q2 directly.
- No production approval, live trading, security-level output, or direct Q2
  entry is produced.
